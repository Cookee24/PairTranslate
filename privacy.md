# PairTranslate Privacy Policy

PairTranslate is a browser extension that translates text inline and appends the translated text next to the original content. The extension is designed to minimize data collection and keep translation activity private whenever possible.

## Data we collect
- **Local content access:** PairTranslate accesses the text you select or the page context only to provide an inline translation. No page data is stored or shared beyond what is needed to display the translation on your screen.
- **Translation requests:** When you choose a translation provider (Google Translate, DeepL, Bing, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.), your text is sent to that provider's service. Each provider may collect or log requests according to their own privacy terms; PairTranslate does not retain these requests after they are completed.
- **Usage telemetry:** We do not ship with built-in analytics. If you opt in to any diagnostic feature, it will be clearly disclosed and can be disabled in the extension settings.
- **Permissions:** The extension only requests the permissions necessary for translating selected text and injecting appended translations into web pages. It never requests unnecessary data or system permissions.

## How we use your data
- Selected text is transmitted to the chosen translation/LLM provider only for the duration of the translation call; PairTranslate does not cache or store translations after displaying them.
- Any optional opt-in logs are used only to debug issues or improve compatibility; they are never repurposed for advertising or profiling.

## Data sharing and third parties
- PairTranslate relies on third-party translation services (Google, Bing, DeepL, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, etc.) to produce translations. Please review each provider's privacy policy before using their service through the extension.
- We do not sell, rent, or otherwise monetize your translation activity or browsing data.

## Your choices
- Disable the extension or select “mute” for a provider if you prefer not to transmit text to that service.
- Review and manage optional logging or diagnostic settings directly within the extension.
- Clear local data (such as stored preferences or cached provider choices) via the browser’s extension settings panel.

## Security and updates
- PairTranslate leverages browser security for all interactions and is continuously updated through the browser’s extension mechanism; keep the extension updated to receive privacy and security improvements.
