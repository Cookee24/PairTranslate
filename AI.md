## Project basis

WXT + SolidJS + DaisyUI

Current project is a browser extension to translate text on web pages. Adapt to major translation platforms and LLMs, including Google Translate, Bing, DeepL, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.

Unlike the traditional translation implementation, the extension will append the translated text to the original text, allowing users to see both versions side by side.

### Structure

- `.output/`: All build artifacts will go here
- `.wxt/`: Generated by WXT, it contains TS config
- `assets/`: Contains all CSS, images, and other assets that should be processed by WXT
- `components/`: Auto-imported by default, contains UI components
- `entrypoints/`: Contains all the entrypoints that get bundled into your extension
- `hooks/`: Auto-imported by default, contains source code for your project's hooks for React and Solid
- `modules/`: Contains [local WXT Modules](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/wxt-modules.html) for your project
- `public/`: Contains any files you want to copy into the output folder as-is, without being processed by WXT
- `utils/`: Auto-imported by default, contains generic utilities used throughout your project
- `.env`: Contains [Environment Variables](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/config/environment-variables.html)
- `.env.publish`: Contains Environment Variables for [publishing](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/publishing.html)
- `app.config.ts`: Contains [Runtime Config](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/config/runtime.html)
- `package.json`: The standard file used by your package manager
- `tsconfig.json`: Config telling TypeScript how to behave
- `web-ext.config.ts`: Configure [Browser Startup](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/config/browser-startup.html)
- `wxt.config.ts`: The main config file for WXT projects

For `Auto-imported` folders, you can use symbols exported on the top level files without importing them explicitly.

## Development & Build
- `bun run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `bun run dev:firefox` - Start development server for Firefox
- `bun run build` - Build the extension for Chrome
- `bun run build:firefox` - Build the extension for Firefox  
- `bun run zip` - Package extension into zip file
- `bun run zip:firefox` - Package Firefox extension
- `bun run compile` - Run TypeScript type checking (no emit)
- `bun run lint` - Run Biome linter to check code style
- `bun run lint:fix` - Run Biome linter to fix code style
- `bun run lint:fix:unsafe` - Run Biome linter to fix code style (with unsafe fix)

## Notes

1. Always use context7 when code generation is needed, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
2. ```tsx function MyComponent(props) {
  const { name } = props; // ❌: breaks reactivity and will not update when the prop value changes
  const name = props.name; // ❌: another example of breaking reactivity
  const name = () => props.name; // ✓: by wrapping `props.name` into a function, `name()` always retrieves its current value
  // Same for `createStore` and `createSignal`.
}```
